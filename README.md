14.01.2024 ------------

This is a repository inspired by the youtube video:


[![Veritasium_Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium "What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything")


Where the goal is to recreate the Game described in the video where we create:

- 1v1 Game of Cooperation vs Exploitation
- 16 Different Players (Strategies)
- Tournament Set Up: Number of Matches
- Game Set Up: Number of Games per Match

And with this building blocks, we create different Game Styles as the one described in the game.

The repository, at the beginning will be a mix of jupyter notebooks with trials and errors and later, once things are created, then I'll arrange it into python files.
