# Recreation of "Prisoner's Dilemma" inspired by Veritasium YouTube Channel

This is a repository inspired by the youtube video:

[![Veritasium_Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium "What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything")


Where the goal is to recreate the Game described in the video where we create:

- 1v1 Game of Cooperation vs Exploitation
- 16 Different Players (Strategies)
- Tournament Set Up: Number of Matches
- Game Set Up: Number of Games per Match

And with this building blocks, we create different Game Styles as the one described in the game.

The repository, at the beginning will be a mix of jupyter notebooks with trials and errors and later, once things are created, then I'll arrange it into python files.

Full Disclosure, I'm using ChatGPT to help me build the code.

I was able to create easily this scenario using ChatGPT:
#### First Trial
- Player0 = Random Choice
- Player1 = Always Cooperate
- Player2 = Always Exploit

However when I added a more "complex" player then I got errors because it the Game Class was not supporting them.
I'll try to explore it a bit more in the following Trials
